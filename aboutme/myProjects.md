### Description ###
A simple car highway game where the player controls a car (A) and avoids oncoming traffic (#). As you play you collect points (.) to increase the score, and the player has atotal of 3 lives. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible without crashing.

### What I Learned ###
I learned how to use game loops, event handling, collision detection and also how to add sounds to a moving or colliding object which i found quite interesting. This project deeply improved my understanding of the C# language and the logic behind debugging.

### What I Learned ###
I learned how to use arrays to store monthly rainfall values and loops to process multiple inputs effciently. I practiced writing functions, workingwith return values, and using conditional statements to determine the highest and lowesr rainfall. This project improved my understanding of data processing and program structure in c#.
